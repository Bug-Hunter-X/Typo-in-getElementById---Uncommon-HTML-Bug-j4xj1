# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in HTML/JavaScript: a simple typo in the `getElementById` method.

The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides the correct version.

This bug is uncommon in that it's not a syntax error that the browser immediately flags; instead, it results in a runtime error (likely a `TypeError`).
